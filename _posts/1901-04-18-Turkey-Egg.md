# An Incident in the Life of George S. Bryant

By America Bryant (b 1821)

In the first settlement of Kentucky, when it was all 
in forest and undergrowth and the houses were very far 
apart, my father, 5 years old, got lost and wandered about 
ten miles from home. He started to follow the children 
to school, but lost his way and wandered on and on. 
Toward night he fell across a big log and slept there until 
morning. He was very tired. In the morning when he 
awoke he found a wild turkey's egg, and seeing a log 
cabin not far off he went to it. The door was propped 
shut, like many doors were at that time, and he pushed 
on it and it fell down. The man living there was a Mr. 
Silvers. The first thing my father said when he opened 
the door was, "I want to roast my turkey egg."  The 
man asked him who his father was and he said, "Mars 
Johnny" and that his mother was "Miss Polly." The 
man then asked him what his nanny's name was. He 
told him she was "Nanny Bess." As there were not 
many people who had nannies the man knew then who 
the child must be.  He got on his horse and took the 
child home.  Meanwhile the child's parents were nearly 
distracted and many of the neighbors had hunted all night 
for him. There was much rejoicing when the man brought 
my father home, and my grandmother, who used often to 
tell me the story, said it took several days to pick the 
briars out of his feet.
