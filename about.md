If you are one of my nieces, nephews, cousins, uncles, aunts or siblings and have a story to add, just:

1. Email me
1. Ping me on [twitter](https://www.twitter.com/dkbriand)
1. Stalk me on [github](https://github.com/brianddk)
1. Find me on most social media platforms with either my twitter or github userids
2. Open a ["Story Request" issue on the repo](https://github.com/ourstories/ourstories.github.io/issues/new)
3. Write a draft into the [Wiki](https://github.com/ourstories/ourstories.github.io/wiki)
4. Or just bug Dad, Don, Mom or anyone else that knows how to reach me.

If you lost one of the encyption passwords for one of the stories, or need to request one, just contact me using any of the methods listed above.  I keep some of this stuff encrypted if it is of a generally personal or private nature.
